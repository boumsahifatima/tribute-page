Marie Curie (born Maria Skłodowska) pioneered research into radioactivity, discovered the elements polonium and radium, and carried that work into medical uses (including mobile X-ray units in WWI).

      <h2>Here's a time line of Marie Curie’s life:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1867</strong>— Born Maria Salomea Skłodowska in Warsaw (then part of the Russian Empire).</li>
        <li><strong>1891</strong>— Moves to Paris to study at the Sorbonne (begins higher education in physics and mathematics).</li>
        <li><strong>1898</strong>— Announces the discoveries of two new radioactive elements: polonium (named for her native Poland) and radium.</li>
        <li><strong>1903</strong>— Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel) for their work on radiation phenomena. She is the first woman to win a Nobel Prize</li>
        <li><strong>1914–1918</strong>— During World War I she spearheads the creation of mobile radiography (X-ray) units — the “Petites Curies” — and trained teams to operate them at field hospitals.</li>
        <li><strong>1920</strong>— Plays a leading role in establishing research institutions devoted to radiology and medical applications of radioactivity (the Curie Institute in Paris develops into a major research center).</li>
        <li><strong>1934</strong>— Dies on July 4, 1934, in Passy, France, of aplastic anemia, a condition linked to prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation</li>
      </ul>
